 <h3>So my real name is Hagai Zwick, but I go by Guy (this is what Starbucks staff recommend that I be called).</h3>
   <p>I am from Israel and I came to Cali’ 6 years ago. I am a father to the amazing Ari (2 years old) and our latest addition Liev(2 months old). I am a personal banker for the past two years in the most loving place on earth, Bank of America, and before that I used to own my own business. Which business you ask? Well, do you know those amazing kiosks; small booths in the big mall that normally have Israelis working there? You know, those kiosks that never ever harass you or annoy you?... so those ones. Do not hate me. Selling is the only basic thing that you can hang on to when you come to a new place and don’t know how everything works. </p>

I also traveled a bit around the world. I backpacked by myself in Thailand, Vietnam and Laos for three months. That trip is actually the story of how I ended up here, but this is a tale to tell another night (after 3 beers minimum).

Currently, I am in Marin College finishing my bachelor's degree. When I say finish, I mean 2020 of course. But seriously, I have this vision of my kids (they will be 10 and 8) and my wife in my graduation ceremony. It is not easy to study, work, and raise a family. So kids, stay in school! I know it will take time, but I am in it for the long-run.

Another cool thing I did is live in a commune with 24 other people for around 3 years. This was a cool experience that shaped me and tested my limits. I learned many different things during this time and it was a wonderful experience. Basically, we practiced the socialist way of living, had a shared bank account, income and expenses. We were all dedicating our time to be counselors-guides (this concept does not exist in the USA) to teenagers and children. We used to teach different things and we basically tried to teach important values that kids cannot get in school. For example, how to understand the inner structure of our society, and to ask how we should shape our society, and many other questions about our current reality. We tried to have an opinion if what is happening is good or bad and what we can do with that, and many other examples. I loved that! Education is such a great tool that gives you so much back. I do miss those days sometimes.

I love to run (if I only had more time to actually do it I would be in better shape). I love to play music with my guitar (although I have not played in years). The thing I love the most is being a father. There is no word on this planet that can express how much of a loving-empathetic-amazing experience it is to just roll around and play with your son; to see him grow; to witness how he observes the world around him; to see him begin to talk and experience what the world has to offer him.

This is the main answer to the question why I am in DEV Bootcamp, because when I look at my kids, I know that I will do everything I can for them to have the best lives they possibly can; save for a home that I can call mine, get and provide a good education and a loving environment. I am here because I want them to be able to have all of those important things, and this is the main reason why I decided, for the third time in my life, to make a career change and become a junior web developer. Beside this, my wife works for a big tech company, so I see how good the experience of working there is for her, which made me think that maybe I should also be in a place like that. The tech industry is the future; being creative and expressing yourself in the language of the future: coding, is something that I want to do.

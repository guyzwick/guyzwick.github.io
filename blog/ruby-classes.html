<h3>Today we are going to learn a new concept! It's called Class</h3>

             <p>
'classes act as the factories that build objects. An object built by a certain class is called 'an instance of that class...calling the new method on a class results in an instance being created'(rubymonk website/what is classes)
      	    </p>

      	      <p>
In our class, we are going to check if my son, Ari, Is eating his vegetables and fruits.
What our method does is checking that Ari eat add-list one vegetable, and one fruit. if he doesn't eat add-list one of each, he have to come back to the table, but if he does, he gets 30 minutes of play time.

This is quit a simple method, I could have complicated it more by making sure that the what that Ari eat is really a vegetable and fruit, but i Think this example is enough to demastrie how class works in ruby.
What's also unique to classes and is being demonstrated in this method, is that the input of the fruit and vegetable I enter to the method are being printed in the final text. In order to print that, 2 different method had to work, and to work together in order to check if ari eat enough, and what's the name of this fruits and vegetables

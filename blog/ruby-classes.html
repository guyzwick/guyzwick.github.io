<h3>Hey Kids !
Today we are going to learn a new concept! It's called Class</h3>

             <p>
'classes act as the factories that build objects. An object built by a certain class is called 'an instance of that class...calling the new method on a class results in an instance being created'(rubymonk website/what is classes)
      	    </p>

      	      <p>
let my try to explain what class is, but in a different way-
Let's say you need to make a fruit-salad. For this example, every fruit will be method( method are code that perform a task in code writing) but for now , we will call the method orange, grape, watermelon, pineapple, and apples. you take each fruit and cut it to small tasty pieces and put each fruit in each separate bowl. you put all the bowls on the table one next to another. this stage, of the different bowls represent how your fruit salad would be without classes. In this stage, if you want to eat the fruits, you need to sample your fork each time in a different bowl, this is really shame, since you are missing the eccentric mixed of a fruity mix of all the fruits . Now come in handy the class!, in our story, the class is a big aluminum beautiful bowl that say to all the fruits 'Hey guys! How come each one of you is by yourself?! Come on ! hop in !'' And this is exactly what the fruit did, all of them jump in and mixed and play together and had so allot of fun. Now, when you will taste the fruit-salad, you will enjoy the cuistot taste of an amazing fruit salad.

When you are writing code, you write different commands that mostly exist inside a method, everything the happening inside the method; all the changes, the modified command and so on .. are only available inside the method. In ruby, classes is a great solution that solve this. Classes offers a bigger spectrum which in all the methods and their inner parts (variables, string, number) can co exists together inside the class.

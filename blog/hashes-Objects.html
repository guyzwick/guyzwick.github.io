  <h1>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h1>

 <h3> Ruby Hashes :</h3>
   <p>'A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: 'employee' => "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.'(http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_hashes.htm).</p>

 <h3>JavaScript Objects:</h3>
<p>
'An object method is an object property containing a function definition.JavaScript objects are containers for named values, called properties and methods.'('JavaScript Objects - W3Schools')
</p>


<p>
Well, on the on-going debt 'Is JS similar to Ruby or not ?'' I will take the side that it is pretty similar, and I will  use this blog to show my point.

Here is the first example of how the] two looks like in real life :

<p>I know, you guys think that's about all that they have in common, and the code written in different in both, well you write, there are many differences between the two, but I think that the basic logic below both of them is pretty similar.

back to our case: Hash and Object both are list that have two assigned place, in ruby it's key and value, in JS it's property. Many people feel that it' easier to iterate over elements in ruby, but only in JS you can use the object and to actually assign function to the property, and write a constructor function, that will let you to add a real object from outside the function. so in a way, object can be more manipulated than hash, but they are still very alike.

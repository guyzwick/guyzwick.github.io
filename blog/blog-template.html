How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
We had a nice time talking about different design and on how should we, as a developers, should wireframe and build the website in the best way.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Wireframe is a critical phase in order to be except when you are building your website. when you are at the building process, you have to make it in the best way, and wireframe is what developers with an experience use, we should follow their way to get good result, and using this system help you map and design in the best way.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
I thinks that yes, it is not perfect, and we didn’t build it for many hours. Compare to the time we had to this challenge, I think w did a good job

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I didn’t. sorry :-)

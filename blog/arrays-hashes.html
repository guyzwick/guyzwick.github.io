 <h3> What is Array?</h3>
   <p>An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type the length of an array is established when the array is created'(Arrays - Oracle Documentation') 
Every time that a programmer want to create something with more than one value, let say for an example a list of vegetables, a 'to-do' list, he can use an array. Different than other function on the Ruby language, array is specifically intended to expect argument whichever they are, a number, a word or a sentence. Let's take a sentence for an example, a sentence is made of different word put together ( excuse me for not going in the languages rules with verb and so on ..) We can use that sentence and brake it to different words, we can can compare this word to a word that we are looking for in our database and compare this word, and we can uses this knowledge to understand better the user and it s need. To summarize, array is not a single number, or a single word, it is a list that can contain many arguments inside of it.</p>

 <h3>What is Hash?</h3>
 <p>
A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size..the values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes'(Hash function - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia). If earlier we talked about 'what i an array', hashes is very similar to an array, but beside just creating a list, you have the option to sort it, map it, and give keys and order to the different list items. Imagine a long list of big company like google. Lets say that you are looking in the directory to find someone, How could you find him if all the thousand of people would be just laid on a simple list? Exactly because of his example ( and many other of course ) you need the option to map information. If you want to access your information easily faster and in more efficient way, you should create a well organized list and uses hashes in order to do that. Now you only need to find out which category are the best in order to create an efficient list.

        <!--
        What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I used most of them, I used ‘main’,  ‘nav’,’div’,’article’,’footer’. I think that using more tags help you build and organized the page in the best way. And also help you to plan the page you are building in the most affliction specific way.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements display in an HTML page in the order of the importance that the creator of the page want to address his audience. which means header, footer, section, article, aside, nav. This reflecting the level of importance that the creator want to show to the viewer, for example, if you have a website that write reviews on movies, I have to inform the viewer what is the website is about, the optin and links the website offer, and only then to offer the specific review. You can't just show your review right away, you have to have it in the right contact. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I saw that sublime is even a better tool then i imagine, all do I prefer chrome tools, it is always good to know that there is difrent option out there to help you write HTML code.

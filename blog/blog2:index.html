What does it mean to display inline vs using inline block?

The difference is how you spread your elements. In HTML we uses many different elements (text box or a picture or just a colored box) This elements is the companions of the web page as we know it.In this blog we will focus in two different concepts : inline Vs inline-block .
Inline and inline-locks are two diffrent way we can lay out our elements. the best example is this:

In this example we can see that when we open our Google site, we have 8 option to go back to our history choices. The elements are organized in a unique way, they are organized in two lines which in each line they are laid out in ‘display: inline-block’ this mean that they are organized and coordinated one after another, the space between them is perfect, it is identical and equal.

In the following example we can see that the images are lied out in the ‘inline’ system, which means that there are stack one next to the other.

As we can see, there is no repetitive distance between the pictures, every picture start right where the one before end.

Here is a good diagram that define the difference between ‘inline’ Vs ‘inline-block’.
I would say that in most cases, most pages would use ‘inline-block’ system because it is more organized and it’s just look better. But there are many other examples we can find inline system too, if you are designing a website and you want to create less organized environments, in this case inline would be a preface solution for you.

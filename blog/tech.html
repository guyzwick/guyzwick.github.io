Let start with a bit of History, shall we: 'Research into packet switching started in the early 1960s and packet switched networks such as Mark I at NPL in the UK, ARPANET, CYCLADES, Merit Network, Tymnet, and Telenet, were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols. The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking, where multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks'(Wikipedia:internet). Like many other inventions, the internet expend more than the original intention that the pioneer designer had in their mind. In the History mirror, Internet will be one on the key-element that had shift our society structure, redesign how people communicate, and reshape the way that humans thinks. In this blog, we will go deeper to understand the technical side of the internet, how does the internet works. In a nutshell, if  we want to make it simple and plain; The internet is a cable. this cable is a cable that allowed transformation of information thru the cable. Like every cable, this cable, the internet, have two side. In one side, it is us, let call us the customers, and in the other side, it is the service provider,'ISP' internet service provider. The ISP can transfer this information in different ways; thru a physical cable that is underground and connect between the two points, using the cellular network and transferring the information to singles that bee interpret  by our device (Similar to how our voice is transferred to information and then being complex again in the other end of the phone, so we can hear a real voice) or thru satiates, but in all this, all of the three system is transferring information, just like a regular cable do.'So where all the date is being stored?' well, in the provider side, on date server, like 'Gmail', 'Facebook', 'AOL' and so on. So just to clear a point, there is no 'floating information' all the information is stored in a certain place, a server, and begin transfer thru the cable, the internet, when being called. For an example, this is the processes that happen whenever we open our mail in out Gmail account.

'So how come the information doesn't get confused all the time?'' you must be asking, well every website I named earlier, have a number name, an 'IP' address. This number is unique specifically for this server.Another important point for this understanding, that in order for the information we are sending or receiving to move from one place to another, the internet uses server to help it move. 
Let say I am sending an email, my information need to cross a long distance from my computer to Gmail servers. This long distance is been broken down to smaller distance. What happen is, that every time a server is sending it to this closest server in the relevant way, until my information will get to Gmail server. This might use 15 server and even more. every move from my computer to the server is being made thru a router that send it to another router, and so on, until it get the final destination, in our examples, Gmail servers. Now to answer the original question in this paragraph; The router is programmed this way so they break down the ip address so the information will go at the right direction, and this what prevent information to get to the wrong place.

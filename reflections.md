1.1 think about time refloction:

I learned about time boxing,  the fogg method , and the power of meditation, and good tips on how to create tiny habits in your life.. Time boxing is used by trying to solve a problem with a time frame instead of solving a problem by just trying to solve it.
I believe I manage my time in a pretty effective way. There are some ares that I want to improve, such as give my self more brakes, instead of working for 3-4 hours straight and "burn" myself.
I believe my current strategy is good. Last year,when I got back to college, it took me a while to find what I need to do in order to keep myself focus. I have many ways doing it today; first, I tries not to study at my home, it always make me do other things then study. Second, I always hear instrumental music at the background, I noticed that having music help my "control" my desire to get out of focus, and by dividing my attention this way, It help me focus with studding.
I want to try to the Fogg method in order to help me to leave a healthier life and I also want to use the 10 minutes meditation a day. I looks like a smart start move.
My overall plan is to take 50 min studding and 10 min brakes. studding Monday thru Friday, and have the weekend off, so I can be free to relax my mind and be with my family.
It also impotent for me to make sure I have enough time to study so I wont be perused.

1.2 The command line refloction:

1.Shell is an old operation system that is still been used since the 1960's. In the good-old-days, the computer was a big expansive machines that didn't had any screen. shell is a unique system because of her "command-line interpreter (Links to an external site.) that provides a traditionaluser interface (Links to an external site.) for the Unix (Links to an external site.) operating system (Links to an external site.) ... Users direct the operation of the computer (Links to an external site.) by entering commands as text for acommand line interpreter (Links to an external site.) to execute"(Wikipedya website "shell"). The fact that this system had survived since the 60's and is still being used tell us about the importance of this system, and how it is important for us to know to control it. "bash" is a newer command language that was developed in 1989 by Brain Fox. Bash give us a better control over the shell system.
2.the most challenging part was to try to reamer all the different terms, and try to remember them in a logical order, so I will be able to use them at the next time.
3. I did got stock twice, mainly because it wasn't writing in the instructions to enter"Q" at the end of "less" command, and to enter CTRL^D to end "cat > newplace.txt", but I researched and find the answers.
4.I think that all the commands are important to learn. there is a reason for all those command, and there for, I need to learn them in order to write the best code that I can.
 

-pwd; shows the user the exact folder that he is in, and where that folder is located.

-ls; showes which files is in the folder that were on at the moment.

-mv; is used to move files

-cd; is used to move from one folder to another folder

-../; is used to to look\creat\remove\copy a folder that is inside a folder

-touch' creating an empty file.

-mkdir;is used to make new directory

-less; is used to read a long text file in smaller parts, it helps when you have a large text to read.

-rmdir; is used to remove a directory, to delete

-rm;is used to remove a file, to delete it.

-help; if you forgot a file name, or a command name, 'help' can help you find the name of the command you need.

1.4 Forking and Cloning reflection



1.In order to create a repo you need to click 'add' on you fork button on your Github page.
then you need to click 'new repository' , then a new window will open, on the window you need to enter the repo' name, choose if it is Private or public, and the licencing. The last stage is to click 'create repository' and that's it for the first stage. Now, in order to fork, you will need to click on the 'fork' symbol which is on the right upper corner, and chose your name in the list in the new window that opened. now, you will click on 'copy http' button, which is on the lower right corner. and go to your terminal and paste the copy that you had done. and that's it, if you click 'ls' you will be able to see the files and folders that you can see throw your chrome.
It is important to fork a repository instead of creating a new one because in the end of the proses we need to stage the changed code back to master, and in order to keep on the same code, and in older to prevent mistakes and glitches, we should use the same origin file.
2.I think the main issue I have is that it was allot of information for me, and I just wasn't sure if what i'm doing is the right thing.

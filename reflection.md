	•	What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
	•	I learned that CSS can be a bit tricky from time to time, so you better focus on practicing so you will control and know how to uses Padding, borders and margin in the right way. I learned that padding define the white space between the element content and the element border. That borders properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border, and that margin properties are used to generate space around elements.

	•	What did you learn about CSS positioning?
	•	I learned that you can position the elements in many four different ways; fixed, absolute, relative, and static. each one of those will define and change how the element is placed Vs the other elements. If it’s fixed, and disregard to the other elements positions, or id it is relative and so will position it self in relative way to the other elements. Like I said early, it is knowledge that the time and practice to know how to use right, and to control in the best way and to know ‘which change to do?’ to the elements in order to put it in the place you want, without taking all the other elements out of balance.

	•	What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult? 
	•	I would say that the easiest is just making the element in the right sizes as you was, this is pretty much straight forward. On the other hand, to control the different elements and remember how to position your elements in the right margin, in the right relationship with the other elements, this would take more time to control.

	•	What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
	•	I learned  that The full control on how, where, how-much and basically everything that regarding the element is all control in the CSS. All you really do in the HTML is ‘<div> , you just say, ‘hey, there is an element’ in the HTML, all the rest you do in the css page.
